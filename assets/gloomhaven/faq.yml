    - title: Action
      content: >
        An action is the top half or bottom half of an ability card, or an item or persistent ability that specifically says it grants an "action". An out-of-turn ability (like move or attack) granted by another figure's ability is not an action unless the granting ability says "action".

    - title: Attack Action
      content: >
        An attack action is an action in which an attack is performed. It constitutes any and all attacks made with that specific action. If none of the attack abilities of an action are performed, it is not an attack action.

    - title: Attack Ability
      content: >
        An ability is considered an attack ability if it has the word "attack" printed on the card.

    - title: Attack
      content: >
        An attack is a single attack on a single target that flips over a single attack modifier card. If your attack action is, say, "Attack 3," then there is only one attack in your attack action. If it is "Attack 2, Target 3," then your attack action consists of three separate attacks. If the action contains separate "attack" lines, all are part of the attack action. If the attack is an AoE, all attacks performed as part of the AoE are part of the attack action.

    - title: Attack Effect
      content: >
        An attack effect is an effect attached to the attack. It is applied either during damage resolution or after the attack (see list below). If it happens after the attack, it is applied even if the attack does no damage, including due to the NULL or Curse cards. You must choose whether you will do an effect to an attack before you draw a modifier card. Some modifier cards have their own attack effects and you can choose to apply them after you draw if they qualify as optional effects. Attack effects except Add Target are applied before retaliate (Add Target grants a brand new attack and one attack must be resolved completely before another is performed). Some attacks have Abilities (like Heal) that aren't attack effects but that are still attached to the attack. These abilities are applied after the attack is completely resolved (after retaliate).

    - title: Bottom Ability
      content: >
        For the bottom action, the attacks are resolved after the movement is completely finished (so no enemy retaliations that are out of range of the ending hex). They are considered melee attacks, but you do not have to be adjacent to the targets at the end of the movement. However, you must have LOS to a target from your ending hex in order to attack it. Also, you cannot attack the same target multiple times.

        The bottom ability can be used on allies who are long resting for the round. In such case, when their long rest occurs at the end of the round, they do not recover any discards (because they have none), and thus do not have to lose any cards. They simply perform the other parts of the long rest, healing two hit points and refreshing their spent items.

        So this is probably the most ridiculous action in the game. You're level 9, so have a little fun. The bottom action allows for any class to get the card of any another class in their hand to use as they would their own cards. For instance, the Brute could gain one of the Mindthief's augments. The sky's the limit, except that lost cards that cannot be recovered still cannot be recovered.

        Also, for the top action, it is the ally that loses the cards.

        In general, Augments are persistent ability cards that go in your active area when played. They will give you (not your summons) some persistent bonus (the part with the darker background) to all of your melee attacks once in your active area, and then will also allow you to immediately perform a one-time attack, which benefits from the augment just activated.

        The Augment part of an augment card is an ability and can be skipped so you can play the card for its other abilities and leave a currently active Augment in play.

        Whenever you force a monster to attack, they use the monster attack modifier deck.

        Whenever you force a figure to take an action, unless otherwise noted, the figure still takes their turn during the round.

        For the top action, the bonus does not count negative conditions applied by the attack, since negative conditions are applied after damage is dealt. The bonus only counts negative conditions that were on the target before the attack. It also does not count curse, as that effect is not target specific. For the bottom action, note that there is no plus on the attack line, but there is a plus in the range. This means that the enemy performs an "Attack 2" on another enemy within its base range. Any added effects from the monster's stat card are also applied to the attack, and the monster uses the monster attack modifier deck. This is not a targeted ability.

        In general, Dooms are persistent negative effects applied to a specific enemy that last until you choose to discard the applied doom card, you play a different doom, or the enemy dies.

        Any enemy that has a doom applied to them is considered "doomed."

        Note that while bosses are immune to many negative conditions, they are not immune to dooms. Obstacles with hit points, however, cannot be doomed.

        Note that unless a card specifically says it only affects summoned allies you own, it can affect any summoned ally, including those of other players.

        When there are multiple "on enemy death" effects from Dooms, the players decide the order but all are evaluated together - they all take effect and don't interrupt each other. Also, Doom effects still trigger if the Doom moves from the monster since it was Doomed when those effects were evaluated.

        You cannot have doom tokens on more than one enemy.

This card is technically owned by the ally now, and they can recover it through special actions like any other card they own. These cards should be returned to the Sawbones at the end of the scenario.

        These cards have an X (R1) / M (R2+) on them, but they are not cards that are included in the Sawbones' normal hand. Instead, keep the stack of them off to the side and hand them out to other characters when an ability tells you to. When these cards are discarded, or the scenario ends, return them to the Sawbones' supply.

        For the summon on the bottom, for any attack ability, you can choose to originate it on your hex, or the summon's hex, but not both. So something like "target all enemies within range 4" would target either all enemies within range 4 of you, or all enemies within range 4 of your summon. Keep in mind that you are still the source of the attack, so you would only suffer disadvantage on a ranged attack, or suffer the effects of a non-ranged retaliate, if the attacked enemy was adjacent to you. Also note this summon has no attack action or a base attack value. It cannot be commanded to attack with an "Attack +X" action, but it can be commanded to attack with an "Attack X" action (e.g. the Mindthief's "Possession").

        The bottom is the only action in the game that does not have a base ability. Consuming elements gives you different abilities you can perform in whatever order you want. For instance, you could consume fire, wind, and ice to move 3 hexes, loot 1, and then perform the attack 3, range 3.

        You can put the extra card in your active area to keep track of the bear's attack and move values if you want (consider it a lost card that cannot be recovered), but it should be pretty easy to remember after a game or two.

    - title: Command

        Command actions allow only the bear to perform the abilities on them - not the Beast Tyrant or any other summon.

        Note that unless a card specifically says it only affects summoned allies you own, it can affect any summoned ally, including those of other players.

    - title: Removal

        Can you voluntarily remove the bear from the board? No. However, it is still considered a summoned figure.

        Can the bear open doors with a Command action? No.

        How does the bear running out of hit points interact with the permanent death variant? Like any other summon, the bear will always be available to summon again in the next scenario. Permanent death would only apply if the Beast Tyrant himself ran out of hit points.
