  extra:
    title: Bear Companion
    text: >
      There are a few special rules to take note of when playing the Beast Tyrant, who has a permanent bear summon.

      The bear has:

      * HP: 8 + (2xL)
      * Move: 3
      * Attack: 2
      * Range: 1

      where L is the level of the Beast Tyrant.

      A player can lose cards as normal to negate damage done to the Beast Tyrant or the bear. When the bear drops below 1 hit point, it is removed from the map and cannot return.

      At the beginning of each scenario, the Beast Tyrant immediately summons his bear into an adjacent hex, and the bear acts directly before the Beast Tyrant's turn every round as normal.

      In addition, the Beast Tyrant has specific "Command" actions, which allow the bear to perform actions instead of the Beast Tyrant.
